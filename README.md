# Hi there, I'm Pedro! 👋

I graduated High School in 2025 and I am currently diving deep into technology through a **2-year System Development specialization at WEG**.

I am a dedicated developer who always strives to give my absolute best in every project or task assigned to me.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **improving my Java skills.**
- 🌱 I plan to learn **JavaScript and Python** in the near future.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Although I work in IT, I love being active! In my free time, you'll find me **surfing** 🏄‍♂️ or playing **soccer** ⚽.
